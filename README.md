# Installation

*This guide will only provide installation instructions using Prism Launcher, however the process should be similar with other launchers.*

1. Prism Launcher does not install Java 17 automatically onto your system. You can download Java 17 from [here](https://adoptium.net/) if you do not have it installed on your system.
2. Add your Minecraft account from the dropdown on the top right.
3. Once your account has been added on the same popup on the left side bar select "Java" and make sure that your Java 17 installation is detected and listed correctly in the java path and click "Close".
4. Click on "Add Instance" on the top left and select "Modrinth" from the left sidebar.
5. Search "blumewmew's Stream Modpack" and you should see the modpack listed. Select the desired version and click "OK".
6. Once installation is complete you can double click the pack on the main screen to play.
